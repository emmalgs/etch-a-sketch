# Doodler

#### By _**Emma Gerigscott**_

#### _An app to doodle with!_

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _JavaScript_

## Description

This was an early project assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to learn JavaScript! Although simple, I look fondly on this one, as it was my first experience having some breakthroughs in just actually writing coding. To use it, you type in a number into the number field to set the grid to correspond (i.e. 8x8 or 56x56). Then, by moving your mouse across the grid you can make a doodle! "Clear" resets your doodle.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone repo to your desktop
* Navigate to the top of the directory
* Open index.html in your browser

## Known Bugs

* _Probably could refactor this so that it's a mousedown event_
* _Also it would be fun for users to save doodles on the app_
* _Some additional color changing features would be cool_
